# PoQ
In blockchain technology, consensus protocols serve as mechanisms to reach agreements among a distributed network of nodes. Using a centralized party or consortium, private blockchains achieve high transaction throughput and scalability, Hyperledger Sawtooth is a prominent example of private blockchains that uses Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) (SGX-based) to achieve consensus. In this work, we propose a novel protocol, called **Proof of Queue (PoQ)**, for private *(permissioned)* blockchains, that combines the lottery strategy of PoET with a specialized round-robin algorithm where each node has an equal chance to become a leader (who propose valid data blocks to the chain) with equal access. 

PoQ is relatively scalable without any collision. Similar to PoET, our protocol uses Intel **SGX**, a Trusted Execution Environment, to generate a secure random waiting time to choose a leader, and fairly distribute the leadership role to everyone on the network. *PoQ scales fairness linearly with SGX machines: the more the SGX in the network, the higher the number of chances to be selected as a leader per unit time*. Our analysis and experiments show that PoQ provides significant performance improvements over PoET.
